# RStudio Conference Summary
### 2019-02-02

---




class:

# Overview

- What is RStudio Conference
- Workshops
- Key Takeaways
- RStudio Connect

---

# RStudio Conference

- For all things R and RStuido
- First two days were for workshops
    - Everything from big data/database courses, shiny, reproducible reports, admin, and  introduction courses
- Last two days had talks throughout the day with some keynotes
    - These should all be recorded and are publicly available
    - Includes variety of topics from stories with R to presenting exciting packages that are in development

---

# Workshops: Big Data

- This class showcased the power the RStudio IDE (Integrated development environment) has with connecting directly to a data base
- Plugins are available for all major database types
    - Microsoft SQL Server, Postgres, Redshift, etc
- One of the notable issues with RStudio is loading data into memory. If there is a situation where the data are "big". 
    - "Data &gt; Ram" 
- The R library **dplyr** and **dbplyr** allow the user to only have to know the dplyr syntax to work with the data from a database
    - Wow!

---

# Quick Example

- Create a connection

```r
con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver   = "[your driver's name]",
                      Server   = "[your server's path]",
                      Database = "[your database's name]",
                      UID      = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database user"),
                      PWD      = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password"),
                      Port     = 1433)
```

- *Note*: RStudio Connect allows the system admin to have data connections per user, more on that later
- Create a variable that *references a table*, this referenced table will act like a data frame in R

```r
airports &lt;- tbl(con, in_schema("datawarehouse", "airport"))
```

- This reference will allow us to do anything we want. If you were handed this data frame without context, you wouldn't tell the difference

---

# Quick Example Cont'd

- Simple select all query

```r
airports %&gt;%
  show_query()
```

```r
## &lt;SQL&gt;
## SELECT *
## FROM datawarehouse.airport
```

- Same thing, but just the head of the data; first 6 rows

```r
airports %&gt;%
  head() %&gt;%
  show_query()
```

```r
## &lt;SQL&gt;
## SELECT *
## FROM datawarehouse.airport
## LIMIT 6
```

- **dbplyr** will automatically translate all of our **dplyr** commands into SQL code that will work with our database!

# Summary
- Why is this so great?
- Earlier I mentioned how loading all of this data into memory on a local computer can slow the computer down. Along with slowing down the analysis.
- When we run these chunks of code all of the computing is done on the database side! - With large datasets with will allow users to easily access data from a datasource and carry out an analysis without noticing a drop in speed or coding in R.
- This plays nicely with Apache Spark as well
- With the library **sparklyr** we can go as far as building machine learning models with big data on the database side using the same syntax!
- This can be used with reports, shiny applications &amp; dashboards, and analysis

&lt;!-- Here are some bullet points Matt mentioned that would be beneficial for them to know. I know you can answer these more deeply on how it will help them as a company vs what I lightly know on the topic. --&gt;

---

# RS Connect

- Internal &amp; External Delivery
  - Access for clients, employees, etc
  -Note: Matt says user access infrastructure is not there
- Security &amp; Hosting
  - Microsoft/Azure Auth?

- Key takeaway from conference
- Why we are excited
- How it helps CLA
- Why add more tools? What would this 'R eco system' bring?
- Future tool choosing; how to choose what software to use
