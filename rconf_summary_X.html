# RStudio Conference Summary
### 2019-02-27

---




class:

# Overview

- What is RStudio Conference
- Workshops
- Key Takeaways
- RStudio Connect

---

# RStudio Conference

- For all things R and RStudio
- First two days were for workshops
    - Everything from big data/database courses, shiny, reproducible reports, admin, and  introduction courses
- Last two days had talks throughout the day with keynotes beginning the day
    - These should all be recorded and be publicly available
    - Includes variety of topics from stories with R to presenting exciting packages that are in development

---

# Workshops: Big Data

- This class showcased the power the RStudio IDE (Integrated development environment) is for connecting directly to a database
- Plugins are available for all major database types
    - Microsoft SQL Server, Postgres, Redshift, etc
- One of the notable issues with RStudio is loading data into memory. If there is a situation where the data are "big". 
    - "Data &gt; Ram" 
- The R library **dplyr** and **dbplyr** allow the user to only have to know the dplyr syntax to work with the data from a database (no SQL required)
    - Wow!

---

# Quick Example

- Create a connection

```r
con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      Driver   = "[your driver's name]",
                      Server   = "[your server's path]",
                      Database = "[your database's name]",
                      UID      = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database user"),
                      PWD      = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password"),
                      Port     = 1433)
```

- *Note*: RStudio Connect allows the system admin to have data connections per user, more on that later
- Create a variable that *references a table*, this referenced table will act like a data frame in R

```r
airports &lt;- tbl(con, in_schema("datawarehouse", "airport"))
```

- This reference will allow us to do anything we want. If you were handed this data frame without context, you wouldn't tell the difference

---

# Quick Example Cont'd

- Simple select all query

```r
airports %&gt;%
  show_query()
```

```r
## &lt;SQL&gt;
## SELECT *
## FROM datawarehouse.airport
```

- Same thing, but just the head of the data; first 6 rows

```r
airports %&gt;%
  head() %&gt;%
  show_query()
```

```r
## &lt;SQL&gt;
## SELECT *
## FROM datawarehouse.airport
## LIMIT 6
```

- **dbplyr** will automatically translate all of our **dplyr** commands into SQL code that will work with our database!

# Summary
- Why is this so great?
- Earlier I mentioned how loading all of this data into memory on a local computer can slow the computer down. Along with slowing down the analysis.
- When we run these chunks of code all of the computing is done on the database side! - With large datasets with will allow users to easily access data from a datasource and carry out an analysis without noticing a drop in speed or coding in R.
- This plays nicely with Apache Spark as well
- With the library **sparklyr** we can go as far as building machine learning models with big data on the database side using the same syntax!
- This can be used with reports, shiny applications &amp; dashboards, and analysis

&lt;!-- Here are some bullet points Matt mentioned that would be beneficial for them to know. I know you can answer these more deeply on how it will help them as a company vs what I lightly know on the topic. --&gt;

# Key R Advantages

- Automate the boring stuff, moving away from mundane, labor intensive tasks to work that is intrinsically motivating and satisfying!
    - Extracting data from databases
    - Transforming/Aggregating/Wrangling Data
    - Visualizing Data
    - Analyzing Data
- Provide sleek, interactive client-facing products that allow faster, more powerful insight generation (RStudio Connect/RMarkdown)
- Provide access to large number of machine and statistical learning facilities (including spark and other big data technologies) to reduce manual forecasting and predictions when feasible and desired
- Reduce administrative/time burden when sending reports internally between DA team members, decision makers, etc.
- Have fun!

# How to Choose

- This likely depends on the skills on the team, the job to be completed, the time allotted, and the budget
- New R users will be slower and will encounter a learning curve, similar to learning any programming language
- In general:
    - Can it be scripted in a straightforward fashion? If yes, utilize R (or another scripting language) for that portion to avoid unnecessary time, especially when scaling the process
        - Database access on application start
        - Scheduled tasks for very large data requiring substantial cleaning/aggregation
    - Does the task require substantial ML/statistical learning?
        - R has access to many analytical tools, build code to let these methods all compete with each other, may the best algorithm win
        - Scale analysis over many datasets from many sources
    - Is there a team/time/project-specific reason not to use R? Then keep it as it is
        - Non R-user
        - Client prefers other set-up, such as PowerBI, for their deliverables
        - Existing PowerBI dashboard well developed, plug R into PowerBI to automate manual tasks
        - In most cases, imagine slowly transitioning into R or another scripting language in the long term, at least for data access/cleaning/wrangling (aggregation) and statistical/ML methods

# RS Connect

- Internal &amp; External Delivery
  - Access for clients, employees, etc
      - Authentication via LDAP, built into RStudio Connect product
      - Clients can request accounts through non-secured shiny applications hosted on RStudio connect
      - IT makes decision regarding whether account is admissible, then creates account, access to application provided
      - Internal: depends on already existing Authentication system (seamlessly integrated with LDAP or AD systems)
  - Note: Matt says user access infrastructure is not there
- Security &amp; Hosting
  - Microsoft/Azure Auth?
  - Microsoft Azure works - deploying a Linux box within this framework to run ubuntu/nginx and then install RStudio Connect on top
